One of the main security controls used to protect information online is cryptography. Cryptography is the process of transforming information into a form that unintended readers can't understand. Data of any kind is kept secret using a two-step process: encryption to hide the information, and decryption to unhide it. Imagine sending an email to a friend. The process starts by taking data in its original and readable form, known as plaintext.

Hiding and unhiding private information is a practice that's been around for a long time. Way before computers! One of the earliest cryptographic methods is known as Caesar's cipher. This method is named after a Roman general, Julius Caesar, who ruled the Roman empire near the end of the first century BC. He used it to keep messages between him and his military generals private. Caesar's cipher is a pretty simple algorithm that works by shifting letters in the Roman alphabet forward by a fixed number of spaces. An algorithm is a set of rules that solve a problem.

Specifically in cryptography, a cipher is an algorithm that encrypts information. For example, a message encoded with Caesar's cipher using a shift of 3 would encode an A as a D, a B as an E, a C as an F, and so on. In this example, you could send a friend a message that said, "hello" using a shift of 3, and it would read "khoor." Now, you might be wondering how would you know the shift a message encrypted with Caesar's cipher is using. The answer to that is, you need the key! A cryptographic key is a mechanism that decrypts ciphertext. In our example, the key would tell you that my message is encrypted by 3 shifts.

Caesar's cipher is not widely used today because of a couple of major flaws. One concerns the cipher itself. The other relates to the key. This particular cipher relies entirely on the characters of the Roman alphabet to hide information. For example, consider a message written using the English alphabet, which is only 26 characters.
