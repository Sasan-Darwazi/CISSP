Security controls can be organized into three types: technical, operational, and managerial. Technical control types include the many technologies used to protect assets. This includes encryption, authentication systems, and others.

Operational controls relate to maintaining the day-to-day security environment. Generally, people perform these controls like awareness training and incident response. Managerial controls are centered around how the other two reduce risk. Examples of management controls include policies, standards, and procedures. Typically, organization's security policy outlines the controls needed to achieve their goals. Information privacy plays a key role in these decisions. Information privacy is the protection of unauthorized access and distribution of data.

Security controls should be designed with the principle of least privilege in mind. When they are, they rely on differentiating between data owners and data custodians. A data owner is a person who decides who can access, edit, use, or destroy their information. The idea is very straightforward except in cases where there are multiple owners. For example, the intellectual property of an organization can have multiple data owners. A data custodian is anyone or anything that's responsible for the safe handling, transport, and storage of information. Did you notice that I mentioned, "anything?"
