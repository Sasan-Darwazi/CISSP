Attacker Mindset:
Applying an attacker mindset is a lot like conducting an experiment. It's about causing problems in a controlled environment and evaluating the outcome to gain insights. Adopting an attacker mindset is a beneficial skill in security because it offers a different perspective about the challenges you're trying to solve. The insights you gain can be valuable when it's time to establish a security plan or modify an existing one.

Simulating threats
One method of applying an attacker mindset is using attack simulations. These activities are normally performed in one of two ways: proactively and reactively. Both approaches share a common goal, which is to make systems safer.

Proactive simulations assume the role of an attacker by exploiting vulnerabilities and breaking through defenses. This is sometimes called a red team exercise.

Reactive simulations assume the role of a defender responding to an attack. This is sometimes called a blue team exercise.

Each kind of simulation is a team effort that you might be involved with as an analyst.

Proactive teams tend to spend more time planning their attacks than performing them. If you find yourself engaged in one of these exercises, your team will likely deploy a range of tactics. For example, they might persuade staff into disclosing their login credentials using fictitious emails to evaluate security awareness at the company.
