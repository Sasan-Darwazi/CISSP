Types of hackers
Because the formal definition of a hacker is broad, the term can be a bit ambiguous. In security, it applies to three types of individuals based on their intent:

Unauthorized hackers 

Authorized, or ethical, hackers

Semi-authorized hackers

An unauthorized hacker, or unethical hacker, is an individual who uses their programming skills to commit crimes. Unauthorized hackers are also known as malicious hackers. Skill level ranges widely among this category of hacker. For example, there are hackers with limited skills who canâ€™t write their own malicious software, sometimes called script kiddies. Unauthorized hackers like this carry out attacks using pre-written code that they obtain from other, more skilled hackers.

Authorized, or ethical, hackers refer to individuals who use their programming skills to improve an organization's overall security. These include internal members of a security team who are concerned with testing and evaluating systems to secure the attack surface. They also include external security vendors and freelance hackers that some companies incentivize to find and report vulnerabilities, a practice called bug bounty programs.

Semi-authorized hackers typically refer to individuals who might violate ethical standards, but are not considered malicious. For example, a hacktivist is a person who might use their skills to achieve a political goal. One might exploit security vulnerabilities of a public utility company to spread awareness of their existence. The intentions of these types of threat actors is often to expose security risks that should be addressed before a malicious hacker finds them.
