A vulnerability assessment is the internal review process of an organization's security systems. These assessments work similar to the process of identifying and categorizing vulnerabilities on the CVE list. 
Overall, the goal of a vulnerability assessment is to identify weak points and prevent attacks.

Once they decide what to focus on, vulnerability assessments typically follow a four-step process. 

The first step is identification. Here, scanning tools and manual testing are used to find vulnerabilities. During the identification step, the goal is to understand the current state of a security system, like taking a picture of it. 

The next step of the process is vulnerability analysis. During this step, each of the vulnerabilities that were identified are tested. By being a digital detective, the goal of vulnerability analysis is to find the source of the problem. 

The third step of the process is risk assessment. During this step of the process, a score is assigned to each vulnerability. This score is assigned based on two factors: how severe the impact would be if the vulnerability were to be exploited and the likelihood of this happening. 

The fourth and final step of vulnerability assessment is remediation. It's during this step that the vulnerabilities that can impact the organization are addressed. 
Remediation occurs depending on the severity score assigned during the risk assessment step.
