What is CI/CD and Why Does it Matter?
CI/CD automates the entire software release process, from code creation to deployment. This automation is what enables modern development teams to be agile and respond quickly to user needs. Let's break down the key parts:

Continuous Integration (CI): Building a Solid Foundation
Continuous Integration (CI) is all about frequently merging code changes from different developers into a central location. This triggers automated processes like building the software and running tests. CI catches problems through an automated process: every time code is integrated, the system automatically builds and tests it. This immediate feedback loop reveals integration problems as soon as they occur. CI helps catch integration problems early, leading to higher quality code. Think of it as the foundation of the pipeline.

Continuous Delivery (CD): Ready to Release
Continuous Delivery means your code is always ready to be released to users. After passing automated tests, code is automatically deployed to a staging environment (a practice environment) or prepared for final release. Typically, a manual approval step is still needed before going live to production, which provides a control point.

Continuous Deployment (CD): Fully Automated Releases
Continuous Deployment automates the entire release process. Changes that pass all automated checks are automatically deployed directly to the live production environment, with no manual approval. This is all about speed and efficiency.
