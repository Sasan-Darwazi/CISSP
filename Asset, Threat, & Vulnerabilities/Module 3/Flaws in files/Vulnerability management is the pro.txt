 Vulnerability management is the process of finding and patching vulnerabilities. Vulnerability management helps keep assets safe. It's a method of stopping threats before they can become a problem. Vulnerability management is a four step process. 

The first step is to identify vulnerabilities. The next step is to consider potential exploits of those vulnerabilities. Third is to prepare defenses against threats. And finally, the fourth step is to evaluate those defenses. When the last step ends, the process starts again. Vulnerability management happens in a cycle. It's a regular part of what security teams do because there are always new vulnerabilities to be concerned about. 

These are known as zero-day exploits. A zero-day is an exploit that was previously unknown. The term zero-day refers to the fact that the exploit is happening in real time with zero days to fix it. 

Zero-day exploits are things that don't normally come to mind. For example, this might be a new form of spyware infecting a popular website. 
When zero-day exploits happen, they can leave assets even more vulnerable to threats than they already are. Vulnerability management is the process of finding vulnerabilities and fixing their exploits.
