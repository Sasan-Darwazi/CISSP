Defense in Depth:
Defense in depth is a security model that makes use of this concept. It's a layered approach to vulnerability management that reduces risk. Defense in depth is commonly referred to as the castle approach because it resembles the layered defenses of a castle. In the Middle Ages, these structures were very difficult to penetrate. They featured different defenses, each unique in its design, that posed different challenges for attackers. 

The defense in depth concept can be used to protect any asset. It's mainly used in cybersecurity to protect information using a five layer design. Each layer features a number of security controls that protect information as it travels in and out of the model. The first layer of defense in depth is the perimeter layer. This layer includes some technologies that we've already explored, like usernames and passwords. Mainly, this is a user authentication layer that filters external access. Its function is to only allow access to trusted partners to reach the next layer of defense. 

Second, the network layer is more closely aligned with authorization. The network layer is made up of other technologies like network firewalls and others. Next, is the endpoint layer. Endpoints refer to the devices that have access on a network. They could be devices like a laptop, desktop, or a server. Some examples of technologies that protect these devices are anti-virus software. After that, we get to the application layer. 

This includes all the interfaces that are used to interact with technology. At this layer, security measures are programmed as part of an application. One common example is multi-factor authentication. You may be familiar with having to enter both your password and a code sent by SMS. This is part of the application layer of defense. And finally, the fifth layer of defense is the data layer. At this layer, we've arrived at the critical data that must be protected, like personally identifiable information.
