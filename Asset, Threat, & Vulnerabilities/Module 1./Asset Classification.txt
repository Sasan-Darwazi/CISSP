Asset Classification:

Asset classification is the practice of labeling assets based on the sensitivity and importance to an organization. Organizations label assets differently. Many of them follow a basic classification scheme: public, internal-only, confidential, and restricted. Public assets can be shared with anyone. Internal-only can be shared with anyone in the organization but should not be shared outside of it. And confidential assets should only be accessed by those working on a specific project.

Common asset classifications
Asset classification helps organizations implement an effective risk management strategy. It also helps them prioritize security resources, reduce IT costs, and stay in compliance with legal regulations.

The most common classification scheme is: restricted, confidential, internal-only, and public.

Restricted is the highest level. This category is reserved for incredibly sensitive assets,  like need-to-know information.

Confidential refers to assets whose disclosure may lead to a significant negative impact on an organization.

Internal-only describes assets that are available to employees and business partners.

Public is the lowest level of classification. These assets have no negative consequences to the organization if theyâ€™re released.
