Windows is a closed-source operating system, which means the source code is not shared freely with the public. macOS is partially open source. It has some open-source components, such as macOS’s kernel. macOS also has some closed-source components. 

Linux
The first version of Linux was released in 1991, and other major releases followed in the early 1990s. Linux is a completely open-source operating system, which means that anyone can access Linux and its source code. The open-source nature of Linux allows developers in the Linux community to collaborate.
