Network hardening focuses on network-related security hardening, like port filtering, network access privileges, and encryption over networks. Certain network hardening tasks are performed regularly, while others are performed once and then updated as needed. Some tasks that are regularly performed are firewall rules maintenance, network log analysis, patch updates, and server backups. Earlier, you learned that a log is a record of events that occurs within an organization's systems. Network log analysis is the process of examining network logs to identify events of interest.

These tasks include port filtering on firewalls, network access privileges, and encryption for communication, among many things. Let's start with port filtering. Port filtering can be formed over the network. Port filtering is a firewall function that blocks or allows certain port numbers to limit unwanted communication. A basic principle is that the only ports that are needed are the ones that are allowed. Any port that isn't being used by the normal network operations should be disallowed. This protects against port vulnerabilities.
