Security hardening is the process of strengthening a system to reduce its vulnerability and attack surface. All the potential vulnerabilities that a threat actor could exploit are referred to as a system's attack surface. Let's use an example that compares a network to a house. The attack surface would be all the doors and windows that a robber could use to gain access to that house. Just like putting locks on all the doors and windows in the house, security hardening involves minimizing the attack surface or potential vulnerabilities and keeping a network as secure as possible.

Security hardening can be conducted on any device or system that can be compromised, such as hardware, operating systems, applications, computer networks, and databases. Physical security is also a part of security hardening.


Penetration testers document their findings in a report. Depending on where the test fails, security teams can determine the type of security vulnerabilities that require fixing.
