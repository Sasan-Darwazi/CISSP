Cloud computing is the practice of using remote servers, applications, and network services that are hosted on the internet instead of on local physical devices.

Today, the number of businesses that use cloud computing is increasing every year, so it's important to understand how cloud networks function and how to secure them.


Cloud providers offer an alternative to traditional on-premise networks and allow organizations to have the benefits of the traditional network without storing the devices and managing the network on their own.

A cloud network is a collection of servers or computers that store resources and data in a remote data center that can be accessed via the internet. Because companies don't house the servers at their physical location, these servers are referred to as being "in the cloud".

Cloud service providers offer cloud computing to maintain applications. For example, they provide on-demand storage and processing power that their customers only pay for as needed. They also provide business and web analytics that organizations can use to monitor their web traffic and sales.
