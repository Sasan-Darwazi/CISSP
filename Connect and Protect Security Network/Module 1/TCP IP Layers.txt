Layer one is the network access layer. The network access layer deals with the creation of data packets and their transmission across a network. This includes hardware devices connected to physical cables and switches that direct data to its destination.

Layer two is the Internet layer. The internet layer is where IP addresses are attached to data packets to indicate the location of the sender and receiver. The internet layer also focuses on how networks connect to each other. For example, data packets containing information that determines whether they will stay on the LAN or will be sent to a remote network, like the internet.

The transport layer includes protocols to control the flow of traffic across a network. These protocols permit or deny communication with other devices and include information about the status of the connection. Activities of this layer include error control, which ensures data flows smoothly across the network.


Finally, at the application layer, protocols determine how the data packets will interact with receiving devices. Functions that are organized at the application layer include file transfers and email services.
